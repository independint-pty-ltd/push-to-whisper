# Push-to-Whisper: Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
Push-to-Whisper is a desktop application designed to provide fast, private, and efficient speech-to-text transcription using OpenAI's Whisper model. The application runs entirely locally on the user's machine, ensuring complete privacy and eliminating the need for internet connectivity during operation.

### 1.2 Product Overview
Push-to-Whisper enables users to transcribe speech in real-time using a simple push-to-speak mechanism. Users hold a designated key (Right Control by default) to record audio, and upon release, the application transcribes the speech and inserts the text at the cursor position in any active application.

### 1.3 Target Audience
- Professionals who need to quickly dictate notes, emails, or documents
- Users with accessibility needs who prefer speech input over typing
- Content creators who want to transcribe ideas or scripts
