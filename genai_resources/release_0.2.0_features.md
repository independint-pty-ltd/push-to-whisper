# release/0.2.0 Branch - Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
This branch will implement automatic application updates, enhanced system tray functionality, and a settings configuration GUI.

## 1. Automatic Application Updates

### Core Functionality
- Implement a mechanism to check for application updates periodically
- Compare local version with remote version (GitHub releases)
- Download new version when available
- Apply updates safely without interrupting current operations
- Restart application when appropriate after update installation

### Technical Considerations
- Create an update service that runs in the background
- Implement proper error handling for network issues, download failures
- Add configurable update frequency settings
- Provide update notifications to users

## 2. Enhanced System Tray Functionality

### Current State
- Basic system tray with limited options

### Enhancements
- Add "Check for Updates" option in the system tray menu
- Add "Update Now" option when updates are available
- Add "Open Settings" option to launch settings modal
- Improve tray icon and menu design
- Add visual indicator when updates are available
- Add application status information in the tray tooltip

## 3. Settings Configuration GUI

### Features
- Create a pop-out modal window for settings
- Implement sections for different setting categories:
  - General settings
  - Audio settings
  - Whisper settings
  - Update settings
  - Shortcut configuration
- Provide real-time validation of settings
- Add "Save", "Cancel", and "Reset to Default" buttons
- Ensure settings changes are applied immediately when possible

### Technical Implementation
- Use native GUI components for consistent look and feel
- Implement proper data binding between UI and configuration
- Save settings to the configuration file
- Handle configuration file versioning and migration

## Implementation Approach
1. Create the update service and core functionality
2. Enhance the system tray with new options
3. Develop the settings modal UI
4. Connect all components together
5. Add comprehensive testing for each new feature

## Success Criteria
- Users can receive updates automatically
- Users can check for and initiate updates manually
- Users can configure all application settings through the GUI
- All configuration changes are properly saved and applied
- The application maintains stability during update processes
