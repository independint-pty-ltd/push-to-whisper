# Push-to-Whisper v0.3.2

## Overview
Stability and UX improvements for long-running operation. Adds configurable hotkey (default Right Alt), enforces a 5-minute per-session recording guard that auto-stops and transcribes, improves headphone keepalive to respect configuration, and various internal cleanups.

## New Features
- Configurable activation hotkey via config/CLI and settings UI: `right_alt` (default) or `right_ctrl`.
- Automatic stop at 5 minutes of recording; transcribes current buffer and returns to normal.

## Improvements
- Headphone keepalive honors `headphone_keepalive_interval`; sends a minimal 50ms silent tick to keep devices alive efficiently.
- Unified shutdown handling for better stability over days/weeks of uptime.
- Minor UI and settings clarifications.

## Bug Fixes
- Prevent potential stale lock and unify exit flag usage across modules.

## Technical Changes
- Added `hotkey` to `Args` and config file, and `--hotkey` CLI flag.
- Input listener resolves hotkey at runtime; supports Right Alt (AltGr) or Right Ctrl.
- Added `MAX_RECORDING_DURATION` (5 minutes) guard in audio.

## Breaking Changes
None.

## Installation Notes
- Replace the previous executable and run. On first run, a config file is created/updated to include new defaults.

## Known Issues
- Windows may lock the running `.exe`; stop the app before replacing the executable.
