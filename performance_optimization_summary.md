# Performance Optimization Summary

## Focus: Eliminating System Slowness and Mouse Lag During Transcription

This document summarizes the performance improvements made to address system slowness, particularly mouse movement lag, during transcription operations.

## Key Performance Issues Identified

1. **Main Event Loop Bottleneck**: 100ms tick rate was too slow for responsive UI
2. **Audio Thread Blocking**: 10ms sleep in recording thread caused delays
3. **Transcription Thread Blocking**: Heavy Whisper processing blocked main thread
4. **UI Update Lag**: 10ms sleep in tray icon updates caused UI stuttering
5. **Input Processing Delays**: Long delays in text insertion caused lag
6. **Memory Pressure**: Oversized audio buffer (300s capacity) caused GC pressure
7. **Long Press Threshold**: 50ms threshold felt sluggish

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Main Event Loop Optimization
**File**: `src/main.rs`
- **Change**: Reduced main loop tick rate from 100ms to 16ms (60 FPS)
- **Impact**: Provides smoother, more responsive user interaction
- **Result**: Mouse movements during transcription should feel much more responsive

### 2. Audio Recording Thread Optimization
**File**: `src/audio/mod.rs`
- **Change**: Reduced recording thread sleep from 10ms to 1ms
- **Impact**: Faster response to recording state changes
- **Result**: Quicker audio capture start/stop, less system lag

### 3. Transcription Thread Isolation
**File**: `src/audio/mod.rs`
- **Change**: Moved Whisper transcription to separate lower-priority thread
- **Features**:
  - Windows: `THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL` priority
  - Linux: Relies on thread scheduler (could be enhanced with nice() calls)
- **Impact**: Prevents transcription from blocking main UI thread
- **Result**: System remains responsive during transcription processing

### 4. UI Update Optimization
**File**: `src/ui/mod.rs`
- **Change**: Reduced tray icon update loop sleep from 10ms to 5ms
- **Impact**: More responsive system tray updates
- **Result**: Visual feedback appears faster, less UI lag

### 5. Input Processing Speed Improvements
**File**: `src/input/mod.rs`
- **Changes**:
  - Clipboard operation delay: 50ms → 5ms
  - Character typing delay: 2ms → 1ms
- **Impact**: Faster text insertion after transcription
- **Result**: Text appears more quickly, feels more responsive

### 6. Memory Efficiency Optimization
**File**: `src/audio/mod.rs`
- **Change**: Reduced audio buffer capacity from 300s to 60s
- **Impact**: 80% reduction in memory usage for audio buffer
- **Result**: Less memory pressure, reduced garbage collection impact

### 7. Key Response Optimization
**File**: `src/utils/mod.rs`
- **Change**: Reduced default long press threshold from 50ms to 25ms
- **Impact**: Faster response to hotkey presses
- **Result**: More immediate recording start, feels snappier

### 8. Whisper Processing Optimization
**File**: `src/whisper/mod.rs`
- **Changes**:
  - Enabled GPU explicitly with `with_use_gpu(true)`
  - Added `set_single_segment(true)` for faster processing
  - Added `set_speed_up(true)` for accelerated transcription
  - Reduced audio context to 512 samples for faster processing
- **Impact**: Faster transcription processing
- **Result**: Shorter transcription time, less system blockage

## Performance Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been added in `tests/performance_optimization_test.rs` to validate:

- Main loop responsiveness (16ms target)
- Audio recording thread responsiveness
- UI update timing
- Text input speed
- Memory efficiency (80% improvement)
- System responsiveness during transcription simulation

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- Main loop: 100ms response time
- Audio thread: 10ms delays
- UI updates: 10ms delays  
- Text input: 50ms + 2ms per character
- Memory usage: 300s audio buffer (4.8MB)
- Transcription: Blocks main thread

### After Optimization:
- Main loop: 16ms response time (6.25x faster)
- Audio thread: 1ms delays (10x faster)
- UI updates: 5ms delays (2x faster)
- Text input: 5ms + 1ms per character (10x + 2x faster)
- Memory usage: 60s audio buffer (0.96MB, 80% reduction)
- Transcription: Non-blocking background thread

## Mouse Movement Responsiveness

The primary issue of mouse movement lag during transcription should be significantly improved through:

1. **Faster main event loop** (16ms vs 100ms) ensures mouse events are processed more frequently
2. **Non-blocking transcription** prevents Whisper processing from freezing the UI
3. **Reduced thread sleep times** throughout the system minimize delays
4. **Lower thread priority for transcription** ensures UI threads get priority
5. **Memory pressure reduction** decreases garbage collection impact

## Configuration Backward Compatibility

All optimizations maintain backward compatibility:
- Existing config files will be automatically updated with new defaults
- Command-line arguments continue to work as before
- Users can still adjust thresholds if needed (though new defaults should be better)

## System Requirements

These optimizations are designed to:
- Work on both Windows and Linux
- Utilize GPU acceleration when available
- Gracefully fall back to CPU mode
- Maintain stability while improving performance

The optimizations focus on reducing latency at every level of the application stack, from the main event loop down to individual character typing, specifically targeting the mouse lag issue during transcription operations.
