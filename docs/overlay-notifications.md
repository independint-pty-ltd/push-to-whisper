# Push-to-Whisper Overlay Notification System

## Overview

The new overlay notification system provides non-intrusive visual feedback during recording and transcribing operations. Unlike traditional notifications that can steal focus and interfere with user input, this overlay system is specifically designed to **never move the user's cursor** or interrupt their workflow.

## Key Features

### 1. **No Focus Stealing**
- Uses `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` window style to prevent focus changes
- The overlay window cannot be activated or clicked
- User can continue typing without interruption

### 2. **Unobtrusive Positioning**
- Appears in the bottom-right corner of the screen
- Small size (250x60 pixels)
- Positioned above the taskbar
- Semi-transparent (90% opacity)

### 3. **Clear Visual States**
- **Recording**: Red background with "ðŸ”´ Recording..." text
- **Transcribing**: Orange background with "ðŸŸ  Transcribing..." text
- **Normal**: Overlay is hidden

### 4. **Lightweight Implementation**
- Native Windows API (no external dependencies)
- Minimal resource usage
- Fast state transitions
- Proper cleanup on exit

## Technical Implementation

### Window Creation
```rust
// Key window styles that prevent focus stealing
CreateWindowExW(
    WS_EX_TOPMOST |      // Always on top
    WS_EX_NOACTIVATE |   // Cannot steal focus
    WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW |   // No taskbar button
    WS_EX_LAYERED,       // Supports transparency
    // ... other parameters
);
```

### Why This Approach Works

1. **WS_EX_NOACTIVATE**: This is the critical flag that prevents the window from ever receiving keyboard focus. When this flag is set, Windows will not move focus to this window under any circumstances.

2. **Corner Positioning**: By placing the overlay in the corner rather than center, it stays out of the user's primary work area.

3. **No User Interaction**: The overlay is purely informational - it cannot be clicked, moved, or interacted with in any way.

## Usage

The overlay system integrates seamlessly with the existing Push-to-Whisper workflow:

1. **Press and hold Q**: Overlay appears showing "Recording..."
2. **Release Q**: Overlay changes to "Transcribing..."
3. **Transcription complete**: Overlay disappears, text is inserted at cursor

Throughout this process, the user's cursor never moves, and they maintain full control of their input focus.

## Configuration

The overlay respects the existing visual feedback configuration:

```toml
# In push-to-whisper.config
disable_visual = false  # Set to true to disable the overlay
```

## Comparison with Previous Approaches

| Feature | Previous (PowerShell/Toast) | New (Native Overlay) |
|---------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Focus Stealing | Yes | **No** |
| Position | Center/Random | Fixed (bottom-right) |
| Persistence | Limited duration | Entire operation |
| Performance | Slower (process spawn) | Fast (native) |
| User Interruption | High | **None** |

## Benefits for Users

1. **Uninterrupted Workflow**: Continue typing while recording/transcribing
2. **Clear Status Indication**: Always know what the app is doing
3. **No Cursor Movement**: Text appears exactly where you expect
4. **Professional Appearance**: Clean, minimal design
5. **Reliable Operation**: No timing issues or missed notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Overlay Not Appearing
- Check if `disable_visual` is set to `true` in config
- Ensure Windows desktop composition is enabled
- Try restarting the application

### Overlay Stuck on Screen
- The overlay should automatically close when the app exits
- If stuck, restart the Push-to-Whisper application

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements while maintaining the no-focus-stealing principle:

1. **Configurable Position**: Allow users to choose corner preference
2. **Size Options**: Small/medium/large overlay sizes
3. **Color Themes**: Customizable colors for different states
4. **Animation**: Subtle fade in/out effects
5. **Multi-monitor Support**: Smart positioning for multiple displays

## Conclusion

The overlay notification system represents a significant improvement in user experience. By prioritizing non-intrusive feedback, users can maintain their focus and workflow while still having clear visual indication of the application's state. The cursor never moves, focus never shifts, and transcription happens exactly where the user expects it.
